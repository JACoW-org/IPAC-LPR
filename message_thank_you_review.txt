Dear ##name##,

Thank you for reviewing the paper: ##title##

Your contribution is highly appreciated. Once both reviewers will have submitted their review the Scientific Publication Board of IPAC'23 will take a decision in light of the reviewers' reports. We may contact you if a second round of review is needed.

To complete the Light Peer Review process we may need additional review. If you are available to review an additional manuscript, could you indicate so by filling the form at ##url##

Thank you for your help.

Yours sincerely,
Nicolas Delerue, IPAC'23 Light Peer Review Manager
