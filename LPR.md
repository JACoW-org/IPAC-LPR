# LPR advices

*Initial version written 18/7/2024 by Nicolas Delerue delerue@lal.in2p3.fr*

This file contains advices for the person in charge of the IPAC Light Peer Review based on past years experience.

## Things to do (chronologically):

**1 year before:** Make sure that the LOC has identified a publisher for the LPR volume and included the cost of the LPR in the conference budget. 

**After SPC2:**

Setup the LPR module in indico. See instructions at <module.md>

**At SPC3:**

* Decide LPR parameters:
  * How many papers maximum will be accepted?
  * By which deadline should the papers be submitted?
  * Are all the papers eligible for LPR?
  * Who are the referees? Opt-in or opt-out?
* Decide LPR rules. 
* Agree on the Scientific Publication Board (SPB)

**After SPC3:**

* Ensure you have a contact name with the publisher.
* Download the code at https://github.com/JACoW-org/IPAC-LPR and adapt it to your conference.
* Check with the publisher if they need an author consent form and who should send it to the authors (them or you).

## Things to ask for:

* Ask Jacow if LPR papers can be CAT scanned.

## Things to decide:

* Do you want to accept students referees or not? ND's opinion yes, we could have one referee as a student.
* In which format should the papers be submitted? IoP or Jacow: in the end you will need papers in the IoP format. If the conversion occurs after final referee evaluation, you have to check/trust that the authors did not do any changes during the conversion. If you use the IoP format from the beginning you may loose compatibility with jacow tools (CAT scan,...).
* In the LPR rules make a provision for the SPB to be able to reject a paper as "out of topic" (for example after 5 referees declined to review it) or for papers for which there are no referees available (some topics are so specific that the only expert at the conference is the author of the paper).

## Things to keep in mind:

- If a referee has not accepted to review a paper within a few days, send a remider. If s/he does not reply, don't wait longer, reassign the paper. This is the main source of paper evaluations being late.
- The IoP (if it is the publisher) will ask very late for an author consent form. Check with them for the current version. Ask the authors very early for this form (for example after the initial submission of their paper) or you will lose time chasing them. It is better if this form can be requested at the time of initial submisision.
