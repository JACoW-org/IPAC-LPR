IPAC LPR - Reminder - Please send your Author Declaration form
Dear author,

I sent you a message a few days ago asking you to complete the IoP Author Declaration Form. This is required by the IoP in order to publish the IPAC'23 LPR papers.

Could you please fill the file available at https://www.ipac23.org/documents/AuthorDeclarationForm_IPAC23.pdf and return it to me as soon as possible? 

The IoP policies available here: https://publishingsupport.iopscience.iop.org/questions/iop-proceedings-licence/ and there: https://publishingsupport.iopscience.iop.org/ethical-policy-journals/ 
 
You can return the file either by uploading it at https://filesender.renater.fr/?s=upload&vid=a91cbe07-992e-45e0-b425-b42d6593a32f or by replying to this email.

For the title of the paper, please use the title as it is in the final version of your paper.

As Paper ID, please use the paper contribution ID below:

Paper title: ##title##
Paper contribution id: ##paper_id##

If you already replied to my previous request, please let me know with the date on which you sent the form as it has not been recorded.

Sorry for this last minute request that has been passed on us by the IoP.

Thank you in advance,

Nicolas Delerue
IPAC'23 LPR Manager
